* Automatic package updates

  This script provides functionality for automatically updating your Emacs
  packages periodically. It is specially usefull for people that work in
  multiple machines and tend to forget to manually update packages from time to
  time.

  The main idea is that you set a desired periodicity for the updates, and when
  you start Emacs, the packages will be automatically updated if enough days
  have passed since the last update.

*** Installation
    You can install via `MELPA=, or manually by downloading =auto-package-update.el= and
    adding the following to your init file:

    ```lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/auto-package-update")
    (require 'auto-package-update)
    ```
*** Usage

    If =auto-package-update.el= is installed properly, you can add the following
    line to your =.emacs=.

    #+begin_src elisp
(apu-update-packages-if-needed)
    #+end_src

    This will update your installed packages if there is an update pending

*** Customization

    The periodicity (in days) of the update is given by the custom variable
    =apu-package-update-interval=.

    #+begin_src elisp
(setq apu-package-update-interval 14)
    #+end_src
